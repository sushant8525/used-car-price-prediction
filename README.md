<h2> :book:Introduction</h2>
Determining whether the listed price of a used car is a
challenging task, due to the many factors that drive a used
vehicle’s price on the market. The focus of this project is
developing machine learning models that can accurately
predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order
to make informed purchases. We implement and evaluate
various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale
prices of different makes and models .

<h2> :book:Conclusion</h2>
The increased prices of new cars and the financial
incapability of the customers to buy them, Used Car sales are
on a global increase. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a
Used Car Price Prediction system which effectively
determines the worthiness of the car using a variety of
features. The proposed system will help to determine the
accurate price of used car price prediction.
